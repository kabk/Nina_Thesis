            <p><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></br></br> The Islamic State is a relatively young terrorist organisation. Its creation started in 2006, when Al-Qaeda in Irak gathered with 5 other djihadist groups in order to create the Mujahideen Shura Council in Irak. The 29th of June 2014, a caliphate was proclaimed and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was naimed as its caliph. At the time of writing this essay, the group defies all competition as it is turning out to be the most violent and well-funded djihadist organization in history.
            On August 2014, the IS uploaded a video to Youtube entitled "A Message to America" showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley. Following this savage execution, the islamist group has been releasing other videos in the same gender, attracting really fastly the attention of the whole world. Analysing more deeply the IS’ way of communicating, it appears that those brutal videos are actually just a small part of a much bigger communication strategy, consisting in designing films, magazines and games in order to promote the group’s identity. The IS is attracting fighters from all over the world by producing high quality visuals based on the plagiarism of Western cultural codes.</br></br>
            The IS’ visuals are troubling in the way that they are displaying cruelty, but also because they aesthetically produce a mimetism of western productions. Those visuals act like evidences of the IS’ existence but have, at the same time, a sort of uncaninness that make them feel unreal. The thin boundary between fiction an reality in IS’ visuals participate in creating an intellectual uncertainity in western minds, leading to fear and fascination for a vocabulary of visuals that we know, and yet, have never seen before. </p>

            <p><a name="intro">THE ISLAMIC STATE VS AL QAEDA</a></br></br>The history of the IS is very close to 
            Al-Qaeda’s one. Being at first one of its branches,the IS took progressively distance with its parent organization for finally cutting all ties with it. In February 2014, Al-Qaeda described the IS as being a brutal and intractable group. In terms of strategy, the two groups have very different ways of proceeding. In fact, recreating a caliphate as being a pure islamic state was also Osama Bin Laden’s greatest dream, but what Al-Qaeda was trying to build in years, the impatient IS wants to create in an instant. By proclaming the caliphate in June, the IS has been overshadowing Al-Qaeda and gathering a brand new jihadist generation who got spread out after the assassinate of Bin Laden and who were looking for a new spiritual home. Engaged in an ethnic cleansing, the IS has been developping a strategy consisting in first : «purifying» the islamic state and second : expanding to the rest of the world. Unlike its predecessor who had different targets at the same time, the IS wants to show that it is following a clear goal, with a well-thought strategy that nobody can stop. In fact, the division between Al-Qaeda and the IS can basically be compared to a conflict of generations : a dusty Al-Qaeda believing in a kind of «traditionnal» terrorism and a young and dynamic IS breaking every rules. This generation gap finds its best illustration in the way the two groups have been settling their communication strategy and mainly their visual propaganda. From the very first moments, islamist groups have been using visual propaganda in order to broadcast their convictions, to claim the ownership of an attack and above all, to get an international recognition. It is difficult to know when has been released the first islamist video, but what is sure is that its first main push happened with the 11th of September attacks in America. Bin Laden, has being Al-Qaeda’s leader at that time, released a few audio and rapidly video documents in which he claimed the paternity of the attacks. A video released on the 9th of November 2011 is considered as being the first Al-Qaeda’s video.   </p>

            <p>During about 9 minutes, the video is showing Bin Laden and a few of his «collegues» talking and laughing about the attacks. The quality of the video is pretty bad : shot in a square frame, the video displays on the bottom the date and time of the film in a 90’s style that was already a bit outdated in 2001. The camera appears to be standing on a tripod and the only effects that are rythming the whole movie are a few zoom-in/zoom-out on the faces of the different protagonists. Putting this video out of its context (if possible), the film is not really different from a hand-made family movie that could be shot for any gathering event. It almost looks difficult to believe that those smiling men, quietly sitting on pillows, actually planned an attack that killed around 3000 persons. What can however catch attention is the attention that has been put to attach english subtitles to the video; these are the very beginnings of an internationalisation of the propaganda that the IS will later push to its extreme. The next videos from Al-Qaeda have never really seen their style changing. Most of the time they are being shot in a sort of minimalism, displaying one of the main leaders standing in front of a beige background, face to camera, and making new declarations and threats.
            The IS’ videos are light years away from Al-Qaeda’s ones. It’s almost as if the IS looked at Al-Qaeda’s blured, dull camcorder sermons of a decade ago and concluded that extremist Islam really needed a fresh and energetic renewal. If the first IS’ video is sort of following the tradition of men standing face to camera and making declarations, the whole setting around it completely changed. The video starts with photoshoped photos of fighters, the backgrounds are now different exterior scenes, the fighters pictures appear in a slow motion effect and type is hierarchised, directly included in the video. Far from Al-Qaeda’s english subtitles, the whole video is set in English, from the fighters declarations to the pieces of text accompanying the images. The evolution of style between the two groups is huge; unlike Al-Qaeda, the IS videos look like they are part of a much wider marketing strategy whose main target is the entire world. Every aspects of their visual propaganda seems to be controlled, with no space for amateuristic mistakes. </p>

            <p>100% IMAGE CONTROL <br><br>
            A clear way of seeing the importance of control that the IS is putting on its image is by analysing how the image of the leader is being used. The new caliph, Abou Bakr al-Baghdadi became in a very short period sort of the new Osama Bin Laden of our time. But unlike Bin Laden who was present on almost every Al-Qaeda’s videos, Baghdadi is nowhere to be seen. Only two pictures and the video of the caliphat declaration can be found of him while he’s the first djihadist leader to control this amount of fighters.When Bin Laden was acting like a «pop-star» leader, often talking alone in his videos, Baghdadi almost doesn’t talk at all, only a few audio messages appear to be from him. Baghdadi is cultivating his image of an «invisible djihadist», with only his cruelty talking for him. This silence and absence participate to reinforce the myth of his personnality. Actually, Abou Bakr al-Baghdadi is giving a great attention to the control of his image, being totally aware of the power of a communicaton strategy. The difference of the two leaders’ behaviours finds its best illustration in the visuals that are being produced: Al-Qaeda’s visuals were about declaring whereas IS’ visuals are about showing.
            The IS takes a great effort in producing striking images that have a value of testimony, giving an «inside glimpse» of how sanguinary can IS members be, putting the viewer into the «intimacy» of a tragic scene. Most of the IS’ execution pictures follow a manichean division in the way they are constructed: on one side the IS murderers, standing and using their guns, are creating strong dark vertical lines in the pictures. On the other side, the victims are very often lying on the ground in an horizontal position. It is interesting to notice that the way the IS is showing power by its images is actually quite simple, a basic opposition between power and prostration, one standing one lying. However, a precise analysis of those images made by Tungstène (a software analysing mathematic structures of pictures) reveals that those images have been scrupulously edited. </p>
