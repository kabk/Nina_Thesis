                <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
                The Islamic State is a relatively young terrorist organisation. Its creation started in 2006, when Al-Qaeda in Irak gathered with 5 other djihadist groups in order to create the Mujahideen Shura Council in Irak. The 29th of June 2014, a caliphate was proclaimed and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was naimed as its caliph. At the time of writing this essay, the group defies all competition as it is turning out to be the most violent and well-funded djihadist organization in history.</br></br>

                On August 2014, the IS uploaded a video to Youtube entitled «A Message to America» showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley. Following this savage execution, the islamist group has been releasing other videos in the same gender, attracting really fastly the attention of the whole world.Analysing more deeply the IS’ way of communicating, it appears that those brutal videos are actually just a small part of a much bigger communication strategy, consisting in designing films, magazines and games in order to promote the group’s identity. The IS is attracting fighters from all over the world by producing high quality visuals based on the plagiarism of Western cultural codes.</br></br>

                The IS’ visuals are troubling in the way that they are displaying cruelty, but also because they aesthetically produce a mimetism of western productions. Those visuals act like evidences of the IS’ existence but have, at the same time, a sort of uncaninness that make them feel unreal. The thin boundary between fiction an reality in IS’ visuals participate in creating an intellectual uncertainity in western minds, leading to fear and fascination for a vocabulary of visuals that we know, and yet, have never seen before.
            </br></br>
                 <b>A BRAND NEW AESTHETIC</b></br></br>
                 <b>THE ISLAMIC STATE VS AL QAEDA</b>
                 The history of the IS is very close to Al-Qaeda. Being at first one of its branches,the IS took progressively distance with its parent organization for finally cutting all ties with it. In February 2014, Al-Qaeda described the IS as being a brutal and intractable group. In terms of strategy, the two groups have very different ways of proceeding. Recreating a caliphate as being a pure islamic state was also Osama Bin Laden’s greatest dream, but what Al-Qaeda was trying to build in years, the impatient IS wants to create now. By proclaming the caliphate in June, the IS is overshadowing Al-Qaeda and gathering a brand new jihadist generation who got spread out after the assassinate of Bin Laden and who were looking for a new spiritual home. Engaged in an ethnic cleansing, the IS has been developping a strategy consisting in first : «purifying» the islamic states and second : expanding to the rest of the world. Unlike its predecessor who had different targets at the same time, the IS wants to show that it is following a clear goal, with a well-thought strategy that nobody can stop. In fact, the division between Al-Qaeda and the IS can basically be compared to a conflict of generations : a dusty Al-Qaeda believing in a kind of «traditionnal» terrorism and a young and dynamic IS breaking every rules. This generation gap finds its best illustration in the way the two groups have been settling their communication strategy and mainly their visual propaganda. 
                </br></br>From the very first moments, islamist groups have been using visual propaganda in order to broadcast their convictions, to claim the ownership of an attack and above all, to get an international recognition. It is difficult to know when has been released the first islamist video, but what is sure is that its first main push happened with the 11th of September attacks in America. Bin Laden, has being Al-Qaeda’s leader at that time, released a few audio and rapidly video documents in which he claimed the paternity of the attacks. A video released on the 9th of November 2011 is considered as being the first Al-Qaeda’s video. During about 9 minutes, the video is showing Bin Laden and a few of his «collegues» chilling, laughing and talking about the attacks. The quality of the video is pretty bad : shot in a square frame, the video displays on the bottom the date and time of the film in a 90’s style that was already a bit outdated in 2001. The camera appears to be standing on a tripod and the only effects that are rythming the whole movie are a few zoom-in/zoom-out on the faces of the different protagonists. Putting this video out of its context (if possible), the film is not really different from a hand-made family movie that could be shot for any gathering event. It almost looks difficult to believe that those smiling men, quietly sitting on pillows, actually planned an attack that killed around 3000 persons. What can however catch attention is the attention that has been put to attach english subtitles to the video, these are the very beginnings of an internationalisation of the propaganda that the IS will later push to its extreme. The next videos from Al-Qaeda have never really seen their style changing. Most of the time they are being shot in a sort of minimalism, displaying one of the main leaders standing in front of a beige background face to the camera and making new declarations and threats.
                </br></br>The IS’ videos are light years away from Al-Qaeda’s ones. It’s almost as if the IS looked at Al-Qaeda’s blured, dull camcorder sermons of a decade ago and concluded that extremist Islam really needed a fresh and energetic renewal. If the first IS’ video is sort of following the tradition of men standing face to camera and making declarations, the whole setting around it completely changed. The video starts with photoshoped photos of fighters, the backgrounds are now different exterior scenes, the fighters pictures appear in a slow motion effect and type is hierarchised, directly included in the video. Far from Al-Qaeda’s english subtitles, the whole video is set in English, from the fighters declarations to the pieces of text accompanying the images. The evolution of style between the two groups is huge; unlike Al-Qaeda, the IS videos look like they are part of a much wider marketing strategy whose main target is the entire world. Every aspects of their visual propaganda seems to be controlled, with no space for amateuristic mistakes.</br></br>

                <b>100% IMAGE CONTROL</b>
                A clear way of seeing the importance of control that the IS is putting on its image is by analysing how the image of the leader is being used. The new caliph, Abou Bakr al-Baghdadi became in a very short period sort of the new Osama Bin Laden of our time. But unlike Bin Laden who was most of the time present on every Al-Qaeda’s videos, Baghdadi is nowhere to be seen. Only two pictures and the video of the caliphat declaration can be found of him while he’s the first djihadist leader to control this amount of fighters.  When Bin Laden was acting like a «pop-star» leader, often talking alone in his videos, Baghdadi almost doesn’t talk at all, only a few audio messages appear to be from him. Baghdadi is cultivating his image of an «invisible djihadist», with only his cruelty talking for him. This silence and absence participate to reinforce the myth of his personnality. Actually, Abou Bakr al-Baghdadi is giving a great attention to the control of his image, being totally aware of the power of a communicaton strategy. But what could explain that difference of leader behaviours could be the visuals that are being produced in themselves: Al-Qaeda’s visuals were about talking, IS’ visuals are about showing.</br></br>
                The IS takes a great effort in producing striking images with a good quality, a good angle and a good effect. Those images have a value of testimony, they are giving an «inside glimpse» of how sanguinary can IS members be, putting the viewer in the «intimacy» of a tragic scene. Most of the IS’ execution pictures follow a manichean division in the way they are constructed: on one side the IS murderers, standing and using their guns, are creating strong dark vertical lines in the pictures. On the other side, the victims are very often lying on the ground in an horizontal position. It is interesting to notice that the way the IS is showing power by its images is actually quite simple, a basic opposition between power and prostration, one standing one lying. The IS’ executions images are strangely close to historical paintings of the same gender in the way they are constructed.  In The Execution of Maximilian by Edouard Manet, a similar construction can be found. On the right side the hangmen, dressed in black are shooting at their victim. Dust and smoke are present in the background and the victim, not yet lying on the floor, is bending foreward. It is quite surprising to see that «old» codes of representing executions are apparently still the ones who work the best. But what makes the IS’ images new in their way, is that they are showing real horror without modesty, even accentuating bloody details thanks to modern tools.</br></br>
                A precise analysis of those images made by Tungstène (a software analysing mathematic structures of pictures) reveals that those images have been scrupulously edited.  In this image, the area where dust and smoke are the most visible has been edited several times. This could have happen for different purposes, the simpliest one would be that the members wanted to hide something from the picture but it is more probable that this was intended to reveal more dead bodies previously hidden by the dust.  On this picture, the blood has been altered: the color has been saturated and the shape of the pool underneath the head of the victim has been modified, probably in order to make it visually more present.  On this last picture, the text areas have been modified in order to enhance its lisibility. From a technical point of view, those manipulations are quite classic, even a bit rudimentary as it is basically about blurring and reproducing parts of a picture, everyone in the possession of a basic photo editing software would be able to obtain similar results. Speaking more generally, it is obvious that the decisions of making changes are all tending to increase the shocking elements. It is also noticeable that the IS’ images have a sort of evenness in their graphical aspects: all of them are in a rather good quality and denounce the possession of a technical knowledge and, most of all, an awereness of what is striking or not. Thus, trought its images, the IS has developped a visual strategy that is also being implemented in the realisation of videos. With more effects, more length and more control, some of those videos are actually being designed as real movies.</br></br>

                <b>A CASE STUDY: FLAMES OF WAR</b>
                On September 20th of 2014, the Islamic State released a 55-minutes English language film called Flames of War whose purpose is to explain the IS’s seizure of the Syrian Army. The structure of the movie can basically be divided in three main parts. The first one (≈ 8 minutes) is a sort of introduction explaining, with archive images of American presidents and soldiers, the IS’ version of the war’s start. The second one (≈ 34 minutes), is more of an insight into the ground battles, showing explosions, battles, prayers and death. The last one (≈ 13 minutes) consists in the culmination of sanguinary and horror, with group executions and soldiers (apparently) digging their own graves. </br></br>
                What is striking from the very first minutes is the didactic purpose of the movie. Following the footsteps of IS’ communication strategy, the whole movie is accompanied with the english voice of a narrator or, in the case of an arabic one, english subtitles.   At the beginning and the end, extracts from the Quran are being displayed, all translated in english while an arabic voice recites it. Following the rythm of the arabic voice, passages of the texts are being highlighted, allowing non-arabic speakers to make a relation between what they read and what they hear, and yet to feel closer to what is being said and, probably, to learn some parts of the text.  Another feature of the movie is the use of maps that are illustrating the talk. The first one appearing is basically showing the geographical situation of Irak and Sham (the region of Syria) whose names are displayed in a white sans-serif typeface accompagnied with the arabic translation in a light blue. A fire burning in the middle of the names makes clear that these are countries where battles occur. From a graphical point of view, this already shows a bit of a knowledge; even simple, I doubt my mother would be able to do that.  Another map is showing cities of conflicts and two big arrows are describing the moves made by the fighters.  This second map is using the same «graphic line» as the previous one and attests that a reflexion has been made about how to design and make things understandable. </br></br>
                Appart from clearly explaining issues, Flames of War is also excelling in terms of using blockbusters effects.  From bazooka fires to processions in the streets, the movie is rythmed by an alternation between live actions and slow motion effects that create an aura around these specific moments. The use of this effect is reminiscent of action films, where it is being used for dramatic effects such as the famous bullet-dodging effect, popularized by The Matrix.  In opposition to the slow-motion, Flames of War also uses a lot of accumulation of action sequences that are fastly being displayed one after another. This results in dynamic sequences where the jihadists are turning into heros, being on all fronts and showing no mercy for their opponents. In the same way, transitions between sequences are often being made by a burst of flames, going from the bottom to the top of the image and radically «setting the screen in fire».  If the link between those transitions and the smoky title of the movie is far from being subtle, the repetition of this effect at some key moments of the film still participates to anchor the movie in its action gender. Finally, other details such as different camera angles, the raising of the volume for jihadist songs and the evenness of the light color in the sequences are all proofs that behind this movie, people with editing skills have been working and searching for the best effect. 
                To sum up Flames of War, it is patent that the movie inherits its visual vocabulary from action movies and especially from American blockbusters. Despite some defects like a better structure of the «storyline» (the sequences are somewhat repeating themselves), the movie is visually slick and sophisticated. Apart from its cruelty scenes, watching Flames of War is disturbing in the sense that the movie seems to be all aimed to a western audience, clearly explaining facts and copying Hollywood effects. Even the way of designing the title is reminiscent of the very popular TV serie Game of Thrones, with a typeface fairly similar, the use of a line in the construction and a title set in three parts: Game | of | Thrones, Flames | of | war.   
                 Who is behind that ? How and why does the IS aim for Western people ?
             </br></br>
                 <b>PLAGIARIZING WESTERN CULTURAL CODES</b></br></br>
                 <b>FROM MOVIES TO GOODIES</b>
                 As seen before, Flames of War has a lot in common with any Hollywood production. With sounds, effects and images, the IS managed to put together a powerfull propaganda tool. It is even more interesting to note that the strategy built behind the production of those visuals is also very much alike what a western brand would developp for its communication strategy.
                In fact, in May 2014, the IS established its own media branch called “Al-Hayat Media Center”, whose main purpose is to distribute diverse materials in several languages. </br></br>
                Thanks to this media arm, the IS is able to transmit its own content just like any western production company. The logo of Al-Hayat is featured on every media productions made by the IS, attesting the paternity of the content but also adding a sort of institutionalism to what is being broadcasted. The logo, a 3D golden arabic inscription, is not without pointing out the one of the Qatari Tv channel Al Jazeera. Appart from Flames of War (so far the IS’ most advanced video produced), Al-Hayat has been distributing smaller videos, subtitles for existing videos, articles, news reports but also magazines, video series, games and some fashion items. The variety of those productions is really reminiscent from commercial strategies. What comes instantly in mind is the example of the release of a western blockbuster, quickly being followed by an invasion in shops of all sorts of derivated products that can be sold to hooked fans. The IS is completely following this path, extending its propaganda by creating devotion for its group.</br></br>
                Since the establishment of the Al-Hayat Media Center, the IS has been releasing a campaign circulating on Youtube called “Mujatweets”. This campaign is mainly targeting young people from western countries and showing how apparently great is the life under the obedience to the Islamic State. One of its episode (most of them have been deleted from Youtube), is depicting an IS member visiting injured fighters in a hospital and offering them comforting and encouraging words. Another Mujatweet video shows smiling IS members handing out candy and ice cream to cheering children… The production of this video serie is also in itself playing with western cultural codes and their history as the premices of the tv series started in the United States in the 20th century. The power of addiction of those short videos is also well-known : watching one episode is often being followed by the next one and so on, till the viewer becames captivated by the whole plot. Those more “politically correct” messages transmitted in the Mujatweets participate in giving a paradoxal “human” image of the IS fighters.
                 But this the IS has other strings to oits bow. Next to this production of videos, a strange phenomenon appears and consists in the creation of some sorts of “goodies” that are accompanying the online videos. One of them is an online magazine called “Dabiq” first published in July 2014 in different languages including English. On the October 2014 issue, a photoshopped picture on the front cover titled “The Failed Crusade”, depicted IS’ jihadi black flag risen atop the Egyptian obelisk at the center of St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican.  The design of the magazine could be the one of any western magazine, using mainstream layout and typefaces. Another goodie that can be added to this collection is a serie of HTML5 little games promoting Jihad in Syria. If the design of those games stays quite basic and even a bit childish, it is still remarquable to see how Al-Hayat is creating derivated products in order to gain in popularity. A last example is the production of printed shirts in the glory of the Islamic State. Online retailers have begun selling IS-themed T-shirts and hoodies where anyone can purchase a sweatshirt with the group’s logo or full name written in bleak white lettering.</br></br>
                A question that can’t stay silent as seeing these marketing products is : who is behind Al-Hayat and how come that this group is able to play that well with western cultural codes ? According to MEMRI, Al-Hayat “is thought to be an initiative of Abu Talha Al Almani, a former German rapper also known as Deso Dogg, who left Europe to fight alongside the IS”. Fighting against the western world demands a particuliar knowledge of its culture and the IS is completely aware of that, using all of the tools of its generation to elaborate what might be the most elaborated public relations strategy.
            </br></br>

                <b>PROPAGANDA IN THE CURRENT DIGITAL ERA</b>
                Confronting the IS’ communication techniques with what has already been done in the History of propaganda, it appears quite clearly that the IS has not really been inventing something new. The first occurrences of political propaganda goes back to ancient civilisations and has always been having a really tight relation with masse medias. To every period corresponds a special propaganda : the french Napoleon, in the XIXth century, was using his clothes in order to build his famous image whereas in 1935, the nazis were realeasing a film called the Triumph of the Will that earned recognition as being one of the greatest films in history due to its advanced techniques. The IS is following this path, writing a new chapter in this History as it is using typical tools of the digital era in which it takes place.</br></br>
                Films, series, magazines, games… The IS’ propaganda panoply is particularly wide, using all of the tools that are at available in 2014. Internet as being its best ally. When the nazis were using flyers and radio emmissions, the IS is Tweeting, posting videos on Youtube and photos on Instagram. As a comparison, most of Al-Qaeda’s videos were broadcasted via the Quatari TV channel Al Jazeera, which were, then, re-transmitted on the western’s national TV channels. Thanks to Internet, the IS can independantly flood the world with its images and promote its actions without interruptions, constantly uploading new events. Since the summer 2014, the IS members became social media masters, creating their official pages on Facebook and Twitter where they can gather a great amount of followers from all over the world. As said by Peter Neumann, Director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College in London : “[…] they have their own media now where they can put this right out on Twitter and everybody can immediately see it and spread it online”. The internationalisation of the IS’ propaganda is not only a matter of using English speakers and subtitles, it is also about being seen very quickly everywhere in the world and beneficiating from a typical Internet behaviour : the sharing of informations.
                One could then wonder how such pages can still be existing on the social medias and not be quickly deleted from the platforms. Actually, most of the official pages have been deleted since this summer. The answer to this censorship attempt has been found in two different ways by the IS and its followers. The first one is the developpment by the IS of an application called “The Dawn of War”. After installation on a smartphone for instance, the app replaces Twitter or Facebook by providing to its users a newsfeed where live events are being posted. The IS is adding to its range of competences a computer programming skill and is now operational in every field of graphic design. Next to this, an important amount of non-official pages of the group are still running on social medias. In other words, a big part of the IS’ propaganda is made by its followers who, with only an Internet connexion and a laptop, are also designing the IS’ images. </br></br>
                It is not a secret, and even now quite a mainstream statement, to declare that new technologies are developping extremely fast and giving uncredible tools to anybody. But the IS’ propaganda is a glaring example of how those new technologies can give power to anybody that knows how to use them. If it takes time to master all the functions of softwares such as Photoshop or InDesign, it is still possible, or to use basic functions, or even to download a simpler open source software on the web, and to create some propaganda images in a few hours. If one is still struggling, a quick tutorial on the web will help to overcome the difficulties. “The IS’ followers” are aware of that and are not hesitating to produce images to promote the group. Interviewed by Vice News, an IS; Syrian supporter decribed those hand-made propaganda actions : «The graphic design is mostly independent and done by individuals. For example, that picture that said ‘Baghdad, we are coming’ – nobody asked [its creators] to do it, but they did it anyway.» 
                To some extent, the basis of the IS’ propaganda are following the “traditionnal” specifications of any propaganda movement in the way that it is aiming in manipulating crowds by using mass medias. However, what is uncommon (if not being new) is the fact that the IS is directing its propaganda to an audience that is culturally different, with a very accurate knowledge of its particularities.
